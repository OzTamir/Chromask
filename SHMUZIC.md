# SFX
[V] Each colored platform will have a different sound (when correctly landing on it)
    [V] red
    [V] green
    [V] blue
    [V] cyan
    [V] magenta
    [V] yellow
    [V] white

[V] Color Toggle ON
  * Confirms a base color was enabled; should feel active and responsive since it’s used constantly.

[V] Color Toggle OFF
  * Confirms a base color was disabled; usually a softer or lower version of the ON sound.

[V] Jump
  * Immediate feedback for player input; light and neutral so movement always feels responsive.

[V] Game Start
  * Marks the beginning of a run and sets momentum; short, rising, non-dramatic.

[V] Game Over (fall below screen)
  * Clearly communicates the run has ended; downward or fading, not harsh.

[V] Scroll Speed Increase Cue
  * Subtly warns that pressure is increasing before it becomes obvious visually.

[V] Near-Bottom Danger Warning
  * Alerts the player they’re close to losing; quiet and tense, not a loud alarm.

[V] Pause Open
  * Confirms the game has stopped; soft and unobtrusive.

[V] Pause Close
  * Confirms return to action; usually the inverse of Pause Open.

[V] bruh - every 10% platform there will be a “bruh”

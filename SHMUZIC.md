# SFX
[] Each colored platform will have a different sound
    - red
    - green
    - blue
    - cyan
    - magenta
    - yellow
    - white

[] Color Toggle ON
  * Confirms a base color was enabled; should feel active and responsive since it’s used constantly.

[] Color Toggle OFF
  * Confirms a base color was disabled; usually a softer or lower version of the ON sound.

[] Jump
  * Immediate feedback for player input; light and neutral so movement always feels responsive.

[] Land on Correct (Solid) Platform
  * Signals success and safety; tells the player the color choice was correct.

[] Game Start
  * Marks the beginning of a run and sets momentum; short, rising, non-dramatic.

[] Game Over (fall below screen)
  * Clearly communicates the run has ended; downward or fading, not harsh.

[] Scroll Speed Increase Cue
  * Subtly warns that pressure is increasing before it becomes obvious visually.

[] Near-Bottom Danger Warning
  * Alerts the player they’re close to losing; quiet and tense, not a loud alarm.

[] Ambient Air / Vertical Motion Loop
  * Creates a sense of upward movement and speed; can slowly intensify over time.

[] Pause Open
  * Confirms the game has stopped; soft and unobtrusive.

[] Pause Close
  * Confirms return to action; usually the inverse of Pause Open.

[] bruh - every 10% platform there will be a “bruh”
